# Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a several Hardhat use case. It has multiple sample contracts, a test for each contract, and a script that deploys each contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

Then run any of the deploy scripts. See example:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-bodmas.js
```

Check the `contracts` and `scripts` folder for more sample contracts and deployments, respectively.
